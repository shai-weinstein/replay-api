## Authentication

### Google Oauth 2.0
Google Oauth credentials and some logic stored in `config/passport.js'

#### Login
Go to
```
/auth/login
```
Walk over the auth process
Go to see that you are logged-in:
```
/user/me
```
####  Logout
```
/auth/logout
```

Note! Policies are not implemented

## Some tips
For live-coding we recommend to use nodemon
```
sudo npm install -g nodemon
```
on Windows or Mac OS
```
npm install -g nodemon
```
Afterwords, you do not need to run `sails lift` but just `nodemon`
